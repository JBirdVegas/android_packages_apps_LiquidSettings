*lifecycle of our app so we don't get confused
First Open
Splash Screen :SplashActivity
    -destroys itself after launching
Main Screens
    -users can swipe left to -1 through numeric progression on README.Progression
    -users can swipe right to +1 through said list
    -ALL Activities must follow this Progression list (excluding splash screen)



Progression {

//TODO how to handle swipes when we are at list ends
//    ie. end of list can be debounced, reset to 1, or reset to 6 thus reloading same activity or ignore the swipe in that direction entirely

1) MainActivity
2) GoodiesActivity
3) PerformanceActivity
4) OverclockingActivity
5) ApplicationsActivity
6) SparePartsActivity

}

TODO we should add 3 panels on top of each screen to show what activity is next (+1) or prev (-1) on Progression
